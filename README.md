# Regex-Checker

Regex-Checker is a simple python script I wrote for my college programming class to show my professor I understand regular expressions on a low-level.

## Description

This is a simple program that shows how to use regular expressions in a basic way to parse through two list and provide output to the user on what password was considered the safest due to the presence of symbols in the password list. (ex. '@%^$*') The program is a static command line program that shows the user in a visual fashion what password in the list 'passwords' has symbols in it and what email that password belongs to based on the index. The list are meant to be the same len().
